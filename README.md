## 📌 Projects

### Personal website 
- My personal playground on the internet. Started with a Figma design of my own, scalable website to showcase different projects I work on. Hosted on GitHub pages, so feel free to reuse the template. https://sandaru.me

### Photography portfolio
- Any photographer who take their work serious should have their own portfolio. Not on Squarespace, not on Behance, their own website with high customizability. If you are such a photographer, feel free to clone the repo. https://photography.sandaru.me
